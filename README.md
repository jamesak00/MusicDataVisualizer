# Music Data Visualizer

This script is used in conjuction with the "tracking.sql" database generated from https://github.com/jamesak00/CustomMusicApp

## Usage

Input the directory to the "tracking.sql" database in the "db_path" variable.

Set the date period that you want to observe in the database, either a specific date range or a specific month.
